# Here you can create your own disguises and disguise into them using the normal disguise commands
# To create them is super simple, you're using it just like you would in a command. The only tricky thing is that it must be valid yaml. TIP: Enclose the strings in '
# Please note that this is parsed exactly like a command, no spaces in your playername.
# The following disguises will work if you remove the '#' at the beginning of the line, this creates a disguise which you can use by /disguise libraryaddict. So simple

# To get the skin signiture, you can find it on mojang's servers. Such as https://sessionserver.mojang.com/session/minecraft/profile/<uuid>?unsigned=false
# Just remember to remove the slashes from the UUID, remember the UUID is the unique code given to a player, just google for a tool to see someone's UUID
# Example: https://sessionserver.mojang.com/session/minecraft/profile/a149f81bf7844f8987c554afdd4db533?unsigned=false

# You can also use placeholders in the disguises to create disguises that have the command users skin

# %user-name% - Replaces %user-name% with the command user's name.
# %user-skin% - Replaces %user-skin% with the command user's skin for use with player disguises.

# %target-name% - Finds first viable name from: Player name, entity custom nametag, then entity type (Pig, Horse, Cow)
# %target-skin% - If target is a player, replaces %target-skin% with their skin for use with player disguises
# If target is not a player, will silently fail

#  The below disguise would give a disguised sheep the nametag; Me: libraryaddict, Them: Sheep
#  Example: 'cow setCustomName "Me: %user-name%, Them: %target-name%"'
#
#  This would give the disguised target a player disguise of their own name, but using the skin of the command user
#  Example2: 'player %target-name% setSkin %user-skin%'

Disguises:
#  Warrior: 'zombie setArmor DIAMOND_BOOTS,DIAMOND_LEGGINGS,DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE,DIAMOND_HELMET'
#  Topsy: 'player Dinnerbone setSkin %target-skin%'
